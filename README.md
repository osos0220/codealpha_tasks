# CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship (July‚ÄìAugust 2025)

This repository contains the tasks and hands-on projects I completed during my Cybersecurity Internship at CodeAlpha.
The internship provided real-world experience in network analysis, security awareness, secure coding, and threat detection systems.

## Internship Tasks Overview

###  Task 1: Basic Network Sniffer
- Developed a Python-based packet sniffer using `scapy` and `socket`.
- Analyzed live network packets for source IPs, destination IPs, protocols, and payloads.
- Explored how protocols interact and how raw data flows through networks.

### Task 2: Phishing Awareness Training
- Created an educational module on phishing and social engineering tactics.
- Included real-world examples, best practices, and an interactive quiz.
- Aimed to help users recognize and avoid common phishing techniques.

### Task 3: Secure Coding Review
- Audited sample code for security vulnerabilities using static analysis and manual review.
- Identified common issues like input validation flaws and insecure APIs.
- Provided remediation recommendations and secure coding guidelines.

### üõ°Ô∏è Task 4: Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
- Set up Snort/Suricata for real-time traffic analysis.
- Configured rules to detect intrusions and alert based on malicious patterns.
- Optionally visualized detections using dashboards or logs.
